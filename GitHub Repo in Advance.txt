GitHub Repo in Advance

Consider you gonna create a git repo for a website and add all the additional file
.gitignore , README.md and LICENSE.txt

#git config --global -e (show all the config and tools) 

#LOcal copy with clone
git clone "<url>" -> CLone the github repo and copy it in the local repo

git clone <url> <foldername> create a folder by the name
 rm -rf <file/foldername> -Forcefully remove any file.
 
#Seeding repo with sample content
Download an existing codes for creating a website using SDK/files then push them into the GitHub

#Publish back to GitHub
First time we need to use  > git push origin master
next time > git push is enough

Fetch vs pull

Let's say someone else pushed their changes or changes were updated directly in the remote repo 
then we should follow , bcz our local still say the tree is clean

So always fetch 1st ->  fetch + merge = pull

1. If you want to know what are the changes are done before  you merge the codes in local use fetch
	git fetch
	git status -> to see the difference
now git pull -> accept the changes by saving the file.
then git push -> after accepting the changes which was done by others now I need to add my changes.
	
	
	Git Hub Commits
Go to Github and select any repo and click on the commit header. That will show how many commits were done so far.
1. Click on any commit to see what was changed at that point of time.
2. Copy the commit ID in the local repo enter the following command to see the changes, 
	git show <commitID>
3. Repo Branches - 
	1. Create a branch in Github (remember master is also a branch which can be a default branch)
	Methods: 
	A. Click on Branch -> enter a branch name -> create a new one
4. Want to delete the branch after the purpose of the creation is completed?
	git branch -d <branchName>
5. git branch -a -> To show all the branches
6. Is there any stale branch in your gitbranch /git then use following command !
	git fetch -p ('p' represent pruning of stale branches)
7. Alternative way to create a branch in local and merging with master is, create a branch in github and checkout the changes in local system
	1. If the branch is creates directly in the Github then use git fetch to see the same branch in git bash
	2. use git branch -a to see if this is added or not (remote/origin/branchCreatedInGitHub)
	3. use git checkout branchCreatedInGitHub (switch when there are no local branch available on same name)
	
8. Cleaning Branches after the use.
		A.  To delete the remote branch from the local use the command below,
		git push origin :Update-README ( ':' represent delete remote branch)
